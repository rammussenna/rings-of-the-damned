# Malebolge – Circle of Fraud
### Rings of the Damned – Enemy & Final Boss Design Document

---

## Overview

Malebolge is the eighth circle of Hell — the Circle of Fraud.

This circle is not designed to test raw strength.  
It tests awareness, adaptability, and pattern recognition.

Core Design Pillars:

- Punish predictability
- Manipulate player perception
- Disrupt rhythm
- Reward adaptability
- Encourage mechanical mastery

Malebolge is divided into **10 Bolgias (trenches)**. Each trench introduces a unique mechanical theme that culminates in the final boss encounter.
