### Lore

* Ruled Violence with calculated order and measured brutality.
* Crucior was his enforcer; feared and efficient, but incapable of leadership.
* Stepped down/faked death out of boredom; abandoned the throne for a quieter, controlled life.

* Belted ring fragments signify abandoned absolute power.
* Shop presence in all layers demonstrates his meta-awareness and continued influence.

### Player Interaction Rules

1. Neutral unless attacked.
2. Provocation:

   * Player attacks → multiple verbal warnings.
   * Ignored → instant death / soft meta consequences.
3. Observes Crucior and other bosses, providing commentary before/during/after fights.
4. Shop survives all chaos; always accessible.
5. Multi-layer shop system allows purchasing on credit when N'aix is in a different layer.

### Dialogue Lines

#### Idle / Casual

* “Power shifts. Thrones fall. Empires burn. My doors stay open.”
* “Do what you must. Just… don’t spill blood on the counters.”

#### Player Attacks N'aix

* First warning: “Careful now… you don’t know the company you keep.”
* Second warning: “I warned you. That’s your last chance.”
* Final action: “I gave you warnings.” → one-shot kill / soft meta consequence

#### Out-of-Layer Shop / Debt Lines

* “You better pay me back when you get here.”
* “Aye… I knew I should’ve been there instead.”
* “Don’t think I’ll forget you skipping out on me.”
* “Consider this a loan… one I always collect.”
* Player pays debt: “Good. You’re learning the value of keeping promises.”
* Ignoring debt too long: “I’m patient… but not forever.”

### Multi-Layer Shop Designs

* **Nine Shop Designs**: Each visually and thematically reflects the respective Ring.

  * **Limbo**: Pale stone, foggy, sparse relics.
  * **Lust**: Sultry reds, dim candlelight, faint whispers.
  * **Gluttony**: Overflowing shelves, cluttered, slightly grotesque.
  * **Greed**: Gold accents, heavy locks, opulent display.
  * **Sloth**: Sparse, slow ambient animations, relaxed atmosphere.
  * **Wrath**: Darkened room, subtle cracks in walls, tension in shadows.
  * **Heresy**: Twisted iconography, warped textures.
  * **Violence**: Scarred walls, old weapons, faint blood stains.
  * **Treachery**: Cold, metallic, minimal lighting, eerie quiet.

* **Mechanics**:

  * Player can purchase items in any layer.
  * Out-of-layer purchases incur debt tracked in a counter.
  * Dialogue and environment respond dynamically to layer and debt status.
  * Shop is always a safe zone; enemies cannot enter.

* **Visual / Environmental Cues**:

  * Destroyed boss rings on belt or shelf, faint glow when he speaks.
  * Threshold: enemies halt or avoid entering.
  * Lighting, textures, and ambient effects match layer aesthetic.

* **Audio Cues**:

  * Inside: quiet, calm, no distant threats.
  * Outside: faint rumble or whispers from enemies; emphasizes contrast.
