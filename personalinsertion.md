### Multi-Layer Shop Designs

* **Nine Shop Designs**: Each visually and thematically reflects the respective Ring.

  * **Limbo**: Pale stone, foggy, sparse relics.
  * **Lust**: Sultry reds, dim candlelight, faint whispers.
  * **Gluttony**: Overflowing shelves, cluttered, slightly grotesque.
  * **Greed**: Gold accents, heavy locks, opulent display.
  * **Wrath**: Darkened room, subtle cracks in walls, tension in shadows.
  * **Heresy**: Twisted iconography, warped textures.
  * **Violence**: Scarred walls, old weapons, faint blood stains.
  * **Fraud**: A crooked, dimly lit space cluttered with odd trinkets and mirrors that warp perception.
  * **Treachery**: Cold, metallic, minimal lighting, eerie quiet.

* **Mechanics**:

  * Player can purchase items in any layer.
  * Out-of-layer purchases incur debt tracked in a counter.
  * Dialogue and environment respond dynamically to layer and debt status.
  * Shop is always a safe zone; enemies cannot enter.

* **Visual / Environmental Cues**:

  * Destroyed boss rings on belt or shelf, faint glow when he speaks.
  * Threshold: enemies halt or avoid entering.
  * Lighting, textures, and ambient effects match layer aesthetic.

* **Audio Cues**:

  * Inside: quiet, calm, no distant threats.
  * Outside: faint rumble or whispers from enemies; emphasizes contrast.

# The Fool – Enemy Unit

## Overview
**The Fool** is a gaunt, skeletal unit known across the 9 Rings as a symbol of unheeded passion and tragic folly. Originally a soul caught between Wrath and Lust, he fell in love blindly, was toyed with, and ultimately sacrificed himself for nothing. Now, he exists within the Circle of Wrath as a disposable target, both a gameplay tool and a narrative echo of his past.

## Purpose
- Provides low-risk combat practice after defeating a boss.  
- Allows players to test combos, timing, weapon mechanics, and skill setups.  
- Serves as a subtle lore element, reinforcing the themes of folly, sacrifice, and unrequited desire.

## Behavior
- Minimal aggression.  
- No defensive AI or evasive maneuvers.  
- Primarily absorbs damage, providing visual and mechanical feedback.  
- Staggers and reacts exaggeratedly to hits, reflecting the futility of his past sacrifice.

## Stats (Example)
| Attribute          | Value             |
|------------------|----------------|
| Health             | Very low        |
| Speed              | Slow            |
| Aggression         | None            |
| Damage             | None            |
| Hit Feedback       | High            |

## Lore Integration
- Formerly a soul of Wrath and Lust, now known as **The Fool**.  
- Represents unheeded passion, sacrifice, and the inevitability of being used.  
- Encountering him is both a gameplay mechanic and a narrative reminder of the 9 Rings’ cruel cycles.

## Notes for Developers
- Place in the Circle of Wrath arena post-boss encounter.  
- Ensure visual feedback (flinching, staggering) is clear to the player.  
- Optional: Add environmental cues or subtle audio to hint at his tragic backstory.
