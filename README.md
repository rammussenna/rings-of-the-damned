# rings-of-the-damned
**Genre**: Hack and Slash, Action RPG  
**Themes**: Dante’s Inferno, Biblical Lore, Sins and Judgment  
**Status**: Early Development / Planning Stage
##  Overview
*Rings of the Damned* is a fast-paced hack and slash game inspired by **Dante’s Inferno** and biblical mythology. Players descend through the Nine Circles of Hell, defeating guardians of sin and collecting cursed “rings” that grant power — at a cost.
Each ring represents a layer of hell, providing buffs and debuffs based on the sin. The game explores the themes of **power, corruption, morality, and punishment**.
## Key Mechanics
###  Ring System
- After finishing a layer, the player receives a **Ring of Sin**.
  - Example: `Ring of Limbo` grants extra armor and health but reduces damage and attack speed.
- **Ring Fusion** allows combining two rings to create hybrids:
  - Example: `Limbo + Wrath = Ring of Impatience`  
    - Boosts damage and attack speed that gives a little bit of health regeneration when killed via close range  
    - Reduces health, armor and mana
###  Combat Style
- Real-time hack-and-slash with weapon combos and ring-powered abilities.
- Weapons are inspired by biblical relics, angelic tools, and hellish constructs.
###  Build Customization
- Players can equip up to only 1 fused ring.
- Each ring alters your stats, dialogue options, and how NPCs react to you and what they offer to you.
- Some fused rings are rare and only unlockable through achvievements.
