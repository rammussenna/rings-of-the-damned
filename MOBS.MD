# The Nine Circles of Hell

## Circle 1: Limbo
The virtuous pagans and the unbaptized reside in a state of eternal separation from Heaven. Their punishment is comparatively mild, consisting solely of the everlasting absence of God’s light and grace.

---

## Circle 2: Lust
Lustful souls are trapped in perpetual darkness and swept endlessly by a violent, uncontrollable whirlwind. This torment reflects how they allowed their passions to override reason and self-control in life.

---

## Circle 3: Gluttony
Gluttonous sinners are condemned to lie in a freezing slush of filth and excrement while icy rain and snow fall upon them without end. They are watched over and tormented by the three-headed dog, **Cerberus**.

---

## Circle 4: Greed
The souls of hoarders and spendthrifts are forced into an eternal clash, pushing massive boulders against one another using only their chests. This futile struggle symbolizes their obsessive attachment to material wealth.

---

## Circle 5: Wrathful and Sullen
The **River Styx** forms this circle.
- The wrathful fight endlessly on the surface, clawing and striking one another in blind rage.
- The sullen lie submerged beneath the muddy waters, choking on black sludge as punishment for suppressing their anger in life.

---

## Circle 6: Heresy
Heretics are imprisoned within flaming, open tombs. Their punishment reflects their denial of the soul’s immortality and their rejection of divine truth.

---

## Circle 7: Violence
This circle is divided into three distinct rings:

### Outer Ring – Violence Against Neighbors
Murderers and warmongers are submerged in the boiling river of blood, **Phlegethon**. Centaurs guard the banks, shooting with arrows any soul that attempts to rise above its assigned depth.

### Middle Ring – Violence Against Self
Suicides are transformed into twisted, thorny trees and bushes. Harpies nest in their branches, eternally tearing at their leaves and feeding upon them.

### Inner Ring – Violence Against God, Nature, and Art
Blasphemers and sodomites wander or lie upon a burning desert of scorched sand beneath a constant rain of fire.

---

## Circle 8: Fraud (Malebolge – “Evil Pits”)
A massive stone funnel divided into ten rocky ditches, each reserved for a specific form of deceit:

- **Pits 1 & 2**  
  - Panders and seducers are whipped by demons.  
  - Flatterers are submerged in a ditch filled with human excrement.

- **Pits 3 & 4**  
  - Simoniacs are placed head-first into stone holes, their feet burned by flames.  
  - Sorcerers have their heads twisted backward, forcing them to see only behind them.

- **Pits 5 & 6**  
  - Corrupt politicians (barrators) are immersed in boiling pitch and guarded by demons.  
  - Hypocrites wear ornate, gold-painted cloaks lined with lead, crushing them under immense weight.

- **Pits 7 & 8**  
  - Thieves are tormented by snakes and lizards that bite, burn, fuse with, and reform their bodies.  
  - False counselors are encased within individual pillars of living fire.

- **Pits 9 & 10**  
  - Sowers of discord are endlessly hacked apart by a demon’s blade, only for their wounds to heal repeatedly.  
  - Falsifiers (alchemists, counterfeiters, and perjurers) suffer from horrific diseases and bodily decay.

## Circle 9: Treachery
The final and deepest circle is **Cocytus**, a frozen lake where traitors are encased in ice. The severity of their betrayal determines how deeply they are frozen.

### Inner Core – Judecca
At the center lies **Satan**, a colossal three-faced beast trapped in ice up to his chest. He eternally chews upon the three greatest traitors—**Judas Iscariot, Brutus, and Cassius**—one in each mouth. The beating of his wings perpetually freezes the lake.
