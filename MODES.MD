# Rings of the Damned – Difficulty System

This document defines the **difficulty modes** for *Rings of the Damned (ROTD)*. Difficulty in ROTD is not limited to numerical scaling (enemy HP/damage); instead, it modifies **enemy behavior, ring mechanics, punishment systems, and Hell’s responsiveness to player actions**.

The goal is to ensure that higher difficulties fundamentally change how the game is played.

## Optional Hell Modifiers

These modifiers can be enabled on any difficulty.

* **Iron Faith** – No healing outside sanctuaries
* **Bleeding Rings** – Ring activation drains health
* **Watcher’s Gaze** – Enemies grow stronger if the player hesitates
* **Silent Hell** – No audio cues for enemy attacks
* **Unforgiven** – One death permanently deletes the save

---

## Recommendations

* Default difficulty: **Sinner**
* **Abyssal** should remain locked until beating damned difficulty 
* Difficulty changes allowed **only at sanctuaries**, never mid-combat

---

*This system is designed to scale with future content, additional layers of Hell, and new ring mechanics.*
