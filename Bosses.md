## 9. **treason** Lucifer, the First Traitor (empty)

##  Boss Overview
Lucifer is the final boss of *Rings of the Damned*, embodying betrayal in all its forms. Inspired by Dante’s frozen hell, he begins entombed waist deep in ice beneath the 9th Circle. His form is massive and angelic   corrupted yet divine. He uses a trident forged from shattered halos and shifts between three monstrous heads, each symbolizing a different type of betrayal:
- **God** – Spiritual rebellion
- **Mankind** – Manipulation and deception
- **Self** – Nihilism and despair

##  Boss Phases

### Phase 1: “The Frozen Pact”
- Lucifer remains half-submerged in the lake.
- Attacks are delayed but cover wide areas.
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Ice Spike Trails**: Each time the player dodges, ice spikes erupt where they moved — punishing panic-dodging.
  - **Memory Echoes**: Lucifer clones the player’s **past moves**, creating “ghost” attacks that repeat your previous parry, dash, or strike several seconds later.
  - **Deceptive Dialogue**: He mimics a trusted mentor’s voice (randomized from earlier NPCs), psychologically disarming the player.


### Phase 2 (Below 70% HP): “Shattered Wings”
- Lucifer tears open his wings, summoning **two angelic wraiths** resembling fallen versions of **Michael** and **Gabriel**.
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Wraith Guardians**: These wraiths absorb damage for Lucifer and must be separated and defeated to weaken his defense.
  - **Mirror Teleportation**: Lucifer teleports around the arena — fake reflections will attack, while the real one stays hidden.
  - **Unstable Arena**: The battlefield becomes fractured, with pieces of the frozen lake floating mid-air.

---

### Phase 3 (Below 25% HP): “Judgment Deferred”
- Lucifer breaks free of the ice. His wings ignite in divine fire. The arena turns into a raging inferno.
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Triple Speed**: Lucifer’s speed and aggression triple.
  - **Arena Collapse**: The world breaks down into a space-like void. Floating debris can be used for cover or traversal.
  - **Sound Descent**: All sound is muffled except for the player’s heartbeat and Lucifer’s breathing.
  
##  Unique Mechanic: Betrayal Counter

Lucifer becomes stronger based on the **Betrayal Counter**, a hidden system that tracks:
- Sparing enemies
- Using cursed items
- Trusting certain NPCs or being manipulated

### High Betrayal Counter:
- Lucifer gains more abilities and taunts the player with personalized lines.

### Low Betrayal Counter:
- Lucifer is slightly weaker.
- Some NPCs return to assist during his final phase via items or showing up.

This system ensures that every decision made in the game echoes into the final confrontation.

- **Behavior**:
  - Rapid teleportation and shadow slashes.
