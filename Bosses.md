## 9. **treason** Lucifer, the First Traitor

##  Boss Overview
Lucifer is the final boss of *Rings of the Damned*, embodying betrayal in all its forms. Inspired by Dante’s frozen hell, he begins entombed waist-deep in ice beneath the 9th Circle. His form is massive and angelic — corrupted yet divine. He uses a trident forged from shattered halos and shifts between three monstrous heads, each symbolizing a different type of betrayal:
- **God** – Spiritual rebellion
- **Mankind** – Manipulation and deception
- **Self** – Nihilism and despair

##  Boss Phases

### Phase 1: “The Frozen Pact”
- Lucifer remains half-submerged in the lake.
- Attacks are delayed but cover wide areas.
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Ice Spike Trails**: Each time the player dodges, ice spikes erupt where they moved — punishing panic-dodging.
  - **Memory Echoes**: Lucifer clones the player’s **past moves**, creating “ghost” attacks that repeat your previous parry, dash, or strike several seconds later.
  - **Deceptive Dialogue**: He mimics a trusted mentor’s voice (randomized from earlier NPCs), psychologically disarming the player.


### Phase 2 (Below 70% HP): “Shattered Wings”
- Lucifer tears open his wings, summoning **two angelic wraiths** resembling fallen versions of **Michael** and **Gabriel**.
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Wraith Guardians**: These wraiths absorb damage for Lucifer and must be separated and defeated to weaken his defense.
  - **Mirror Teleportation**: Lucifer teleports through cracked mirrors around the arena — fake reflections will attack, while the real one stays hidden.
  - **Unstable Arena**: The battlefield becomes fractured, with pieces of the frozen lake floating mid-air.

---

### Phase 3 (Below 25% HP): “Judgment Deferred”
- Lucifer breaks free of the ice. His wings ignite in divine fire. The arena turns into a raging inferno.
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Triple Speed**: Lucifer’s speed and aggression triple.
  - **Arena Collapse**: The world breaks down into a space-like void. Floating debris can be used for cover or traversal.
  - **Sound Descent**: All sound is muffled except for the player’s heartbeat and Lucifer’s breathing.
  
##  Unique Mechanic: Betrayal Counter

Lucifer becomes stronger based on the **Betrayal Counter**, a hidden system that tracks:
- Sparing enemies
- Using cursed items
- Trusting certain NPCs or being manipulated

### High Betrayal Counter:
- Lucifer gains more abilities and taunts the player with personalized lines.

### Low Betrayal Counter:
- Lucifer is slightly weaker.
- Some NPCs return to assist during his final phase.

This system ensures that every decision made in the game echoes into the final confrontation.
