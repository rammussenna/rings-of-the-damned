#  Bosses of **Rings of the Damned**

*A comprehensive breakdown of all major bosses encountered across the nine layers of Hell.*

Each boss is designed around its layer’s dominant sin and reflects that in behavior, aesthetics, and mechanics. These are meant to challenge the player not only in skill but in their moral understanding of each sin.
