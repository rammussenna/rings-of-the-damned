	Limbo	A place of relative calm, featuring a shining castle and green meadow, but eternally devoid of God's light and hope of salvation. Home to virtuous pagans and the unbaptized.
2	Lust	A dark, wind-buffeted environment where souls are endlessly whipped and spun by a howling gale, symbolizing how they were swept away by their passions in life.
3	Gluttony	A solitary realm of freezing slush, putrid rain, and snow, where sinners must wallow in the filth they created through their excess. They are also mauled by the three-headed dog, Cerberus.
4	Greed	A barren landscape where misers and spendthrifts are forced to push great weights (representing material possessions) in opposite directions, engaging in a pointless, eternal tug-of-war.
5	Wrath	The murky, stagnant waters of the River Styx. The actively wrathful fight each other on the surface, while the sullen and passively angry are submerged below, choking on their own bitterness.
6	Heresy	Located within the fiery walls of the City of Dis, heretics are entombed in flaming crypts, the heat of the flames dependent on the severity of their divergent beliefs.
7	Violence	A complex circle divided into three rings: a river of boiling blood for those violent against others; a thorny, dark wood where suicide victims are trapped as gnarled trees and fed upon by harpies; and a burning desert plain scorched by falling fire for those violent against God, nature, and art.
8	Fraud	Known as Malebolge (Evil Pits), this circle is a grey, stone funnel divided into ten concentric trenches (bolgias), each with specific, grotesque punishments for various types of fraud, such as being plunged in human waste, boiling tar, or covered in disease.
9	Treachery	The lowest and innermost circle, a frozen lake called Cocytus, reserved for the worst traitors. Sinners are frozen in ice, with the deepest ring containing the worst betrayers, including Judas Iscariot, who is chewed eternally by Satan in the very center of the Earth.
