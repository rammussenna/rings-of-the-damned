The Nine Circles of Hell
#	Circle	Description
1	Limbo	A place of relative calm, marked by a shining castle and green meadows, yet eternally devoid of God’s light and hope of salvation. Home to virtuous pagans and the unbaptized.
2	Lust	A dark, wind-buffeted realm where souls are endlessly whipped and hurled by a howling gale, reflecting how they were swept away by passion in life.
3	Gluttony	A frozen wasteland of slush, putrid rain, and snow. Sinners wallow endlessly in filth, tormented by the three-headed beast Cerberus.
4	Greed	A barren expanse where misers and spendthrifts eternally push massive weights—symbols of material excess—against one another in a futile struggle.
5	Wrath	The foul waters of the River Styx. The wrathful violently clash on the surface, while the sullen lie submerged below, choking on their suppressed rage.
6	Heresy	Located within the flaming walls of the City of Dis. Heretics are sealed in burning crypts, with the intensity of the fire reflecting the gravity of their false beliefs.
7	Violence	Divided into three rings: a river of boiling blood for violence against others; a twisted forest where suicides exist as tortured trees preyed upon by harpies; and a burning desert beneath falling fire for those violent against God, nature, and art.
8	Fraud	Known as Malebolge (the Evil Pits), a vast stone funnel split into ten concentric trenches, each inflicting grotesque punishments tailored to specific acts of deceit.
9	Treachery	The deepest circle: the frozen lake Cocytus. Traitors are encased in ice, with the worst offenders imprisoned at the center of the Earth, where Satan eternally devours Judas Iscariot.
