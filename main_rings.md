# Main Rings

These are the 9 core rings tied to each of Dante’s Inferno-inspired circles of Hell. Each ring grants the player a powerful blessing themed after the associated sin but always comes at a cost. These are not optional buffs  they are double-edged, forcing the player to adapt to both power and punishment.

## Overview

- **Blessings:** Passive buffs that empower the player’s offense, defense, or utility.
- **Curses:** Penalties designed to create build tradeoffs or alter playstyle.
-  Each ring is obtained by defeating the boss of the corresponding circle of Hell.
-  Only one ring can be equipped at a time (outside of fusion mechanics).

## Usage Notes

- These rings are core to the game’s **risk-reward** and **identity customization** system.
- While players can only equip one at a time, **fusion** mechanics (unlocked in after lust boss) allow you to merge rings to gain blended effects at greater cost.
- Some builds benefit more from specific rings:
  - Tank builds synergize with Gluttony or Violence.
  - Glass-cannon mages may lean into Heresy.
  - Stealth or crit builds will maximize Treachery or Fraud.

##  Warnings

- These rings are designed to **shape your playstyle**, not just boost stats.
- Equipping certain rings will **lock out certain NPCs, routes, or endings**.
- Some cursed effects can stack with external conditions (e.g., a Ring of Heresy + plague debuff can kill you faster than expected).
