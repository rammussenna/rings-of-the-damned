ANYTHING RING FUSION IS STILL UNDER WORKS NOT OFFICIAL!
##  Overview

Minos serves as the **Ring Fusion Master**, offering players the ability to fuse rings using rare sacrifices. Over time, his dialogue becomes darker, hinting at deeper costs behind tampering with sin. Eventually, players may choose to betray or destroy him — permanently altering game mechanics and endings.

---

##  Ring Fusion System

Minos allows ring fusion at his throne using the following cost types:
- **Items** (rare loot or offerings from Hell)
- **HP** (permanent max HP sacrifice)
- **Sin Fragments** (gathered from defeated mini-bosses or corrupted events)

Each fusion:
- Creates hybrid rings with both buffs and new risks
- Is **permanent and cannot be reversed**
- Unlocks new combat styles or passive effects
- May modify how Hell responds to the player (e.g. spawn rates, enemy aggression, visual hallucinations)

## Player Choice: Leave or Fight Minos

### Normal Path
- Use Minos to access fusion across your playthrough.
- Each visit reveals more lore about the hierarchy of Hell, ring origins, and your place in it.
- Minos remains passive — unless provoked.

### 🔥 Destruction Path (Optional Secret Boss)
- **Trigger**: Strike the statue of Minos using a fully upgraded Cruciform Blade.
- **Consequence**: Ring Fusion becomes permanently disabled for the rest of the playthrough.
- **Boss Fight**: Minos awakens as a **massive marble judge**, changing phases based on each of the 9 Circles of Hell:

### Ring of Judgment — Traits:
- **Absorbs** fused or broken rings to grow in power.
- Grants massive buffs (damage, speed, immunity to sin effects).
- Can permanently **destroy** specific rings or sin sources.
- **Cleanses entire levels**, removing mechanics 
- Leads toward the **Madness Ending** if overused.

### Madness Ending:
- If Ring of Judgment consumes too many rings:
  - The world distorts.
  - Dialogue and environments shift.
  - Player begins hallucinating prior choices and NPCs.
  - Ending: .......
## 🔁 Core Gameplay Loop It Adds

- **Risk vs Reward**: Choose long-term utility (Fusion) or ultimate power (Judgment).
- **Replayability**: Multiple builds and outcomes depending on player choices.
- **Thematic Integration**: Player’s morality and powerlust physically reshape Hell.
