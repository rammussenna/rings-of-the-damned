## Player Choice: Leave or Fight Minos

### Normal Path
- Use Minos for ring fusion throughout the playthrough.
- Each visit reveals deeper lore:
  - Hierarchy of Hell.

  - Player’s role in the infernal hierarchy.
- Minos remains passive unless provoked.

### Destruction Path (Optional Secret Boss)
- **Trigger:** Strike Minos’ statue with a fully upgraded Cruciform Blade.
- **Consequence:** Ring Fusion becomes permanently disabled.
- **Boss Fight:** Minos awakens as a massive marble judge.
  - Changes phases based on **the 9 Circles of Hell**.
  - **Ring of Judgment Traits:**
    - Absorbs fused or broken rings to grow in power.
    - Gains massive buffs: damage, speed, immunity to sin effects.
    - Can permanently destroy specific rings or sin sources.
    - Cleanses entire levels, removing mechanics.
    - Overuse leads to the **Madness Ending**.
