# Anastasia — The Deception Lord

**Secret Quest Design Document**

---

## Core Themes

* False familiarity
* Trust as a weapon
* Faces that linger

---

## Visibility Rules

* Never marked
* Never tracked
* Never explained

The player is never told to find Anastasia.
They simply keep meeting her.

---

## Quest Overview

This is a **hidden, meta-observational quest**.

Across the world, the player may encounter **nine ordinary figures**:

* No quest triggers
* No rewards
* No explicit importance

Each appears forgettable—until something feels *wrong*.

If the player interacts with **all nine**, the world subtly changes:

* No quest update
* No achievement
* No UI confirmation

Only then does Anastasia reveal herself.

After the **ninth encounter**, the next time the player rests:

> **“You noticed.”**

* The world briefly stutters
* All nine voices overlap

---

## Anastasia Reveals Herself

> “You trusted me nine times.”
> “I never lied.”
> “I was simply everyone you believed.”

Only then does her name appear.

## Design Notes

* No journal entries
* No markers
* No confirmation until completion
* Players can miss it entirely
* Replays feel haunted by recognition
