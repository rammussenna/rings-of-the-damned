# Anastasia — The Deception Lord

**Secret Quest Design Document**

---

## Core Themes

* False familiarity
* Trust as a weapon
* Faces that linger

---

## Visibility Rules

* Never marked
* Never tracked
* Never explained

The player is never told to find Anastasia.
They simply keep meeting her.

---

## Quest Overview

This is a **hidden, meta-observational quest**.

Across the world, the player may encounter **nine ordinary figures**:

* No quest triggers
* No rewards
* No explicit importance

Each appears forgettable—until something feels *wrong*.

If the player interacts with **all nine**, the world subtly changes:

* No quest update
* No achievement
* No UI confirmation

Only then does Anastasia reveal herself.

---

## The Nine Faces of Deception

Anastasia never repeats a role.
Each identity feels appropriate to its environment.

---

### 1. Alex — The Country Girl

* **Location:** Noisy pub near a crossroads
* **Disguise:** Rural drifter with a wide-brimmed hat
* **Behavior:** Laughs easily; buys a drink she never finishes
* **Unsettling Detail:** Her shadow faces the wrong direction

---

### 2. Roman — The Mad Beggar

* **Location:** Outside a ruined city gate
* **Disguise:** Ranting hobo
* **Behavior:** Warns you not to trust familiar voices
* **Unsettling Detail:** Calls you by a name you never gave

---

### 3. Rose — The Flower

* **Location:** Forgotten shrine or grave
* **Disguise:** A single, perfect bloom
* **Behavior:** Examining it causes a whisper
* **Unsettling Detail:** The flower wilts only after you leave

---

### 4. Ritro — The Librarian

* **Location:** Abandoned archive
* **Disguise:** Quiet librarian organizing empty shelves
* **Behavior:** Recommends books describing the player’s past actions
* **Unsettling Detail:** No footsteps, no page sounds

---

### 5. John — The Hidden Wizard

* **Location:** Deep jungle ruins
* **Disguise:** Robed mage studying glyphs
* **Behavior:** Offers guidance, never spells
* **Unsettling Detail:** His spellbook has no pages

---

### 6. Yuki — The Baker

* **Location:** Small town market
* **Disguise:** Cheerful baker
* **Behavior:** Gives free bread that restores nothing
* **Unsettling Detail:** The bread never cools

---

### 7. Thea — The Warrior

* **Location:** Roadside battlefield
* **Disguise:** Samurai-like fighter sharpening her blade
* **Behavior:** Warns against fighting too honestly
* **Unsettling Detail:** Her blade has no edge

---

### 8. Miya — The Noble

* **Location:** Fortified city or palace
* **Disguise:** High-ranking noble
* **Behavior:** Speaks politely; never gives orders
* **Unsettling Detail:** Guards never acknowledge her presence

---

### 9. Hazel — The Child

* **Location:** Anywhere safe
* **Disguise:** Quiet child watching the player
* **Behavior:** Asks if you remember her
* **Unsettling Detail:** Leaves no footprints

---

## Revelation Trigger

After the **ninth encounter**, the next time the player rests:

* A nearby NPC turns and says:

> **“You noticed.”**

* The world briefly stutters
* All nine voices overlap

---

## Anastasia Reveals Herself

> “You trusted me nine times.”
> “I never lied.”
> “I was simply everyone you believed.”

Only then does her name appear.

---

## Design Notes

* No journal entries
* No markers
* No confirmation until completion
* Players can miss it entirely
* Replays feel haunted by recognition

---

## 🜏 Circle Placement

### Primary Circle

* **8th Ring — Fraud (Malebolge)**
  True domain of Anastasia.
  Final revelation and confrontation occur here.

---

## 🌒 Disguise Appearances by Ring

Anastasia’s disguises are scattered intentionally.
She tests trust long before the player understands deception.

---

### Limbo

* **Rose — The Flower**
  Innocent, passive, easily overlooked

---

### Lust

* **Alex — The Country Girl (Pub)**
  Charm without seduction

---

### Gluttony

* **Yuki — The Baker**
  Comfort that gives nothing

---

### Greed

* **Miya — The Noble**
  Authority without power

---

### Wrath

* **Thea — The Warrior**
  Controlled violence, false honor

---

### Heresy

* **Ritro — The Librarian**
  Knowledge without truth

---

### Violence

* **Roman — The Mad Beggar**
  Truth hidden in madness

---

### Fraud

* **John — The Hidden Wizard**
  Guidance that deceives

---

### Treachery (Pre-Final Area)

* **Hazel — The Child**
  Trust without defense

---

## 🩸 Why This Works

* Each disguise mirrors the core sin of its ring
* The player unknowingly *passes Anastasia’s test* with every encounter
* The final reveal in **Fraud** feels inevitable, not arbitrary
* On replays, every interaction feels poisoned

---

## Design Notes

* No journal entries
* No markers
* No confirmation until completion
* Players can miss it entirely
* Replays feel haunted by recognition

# 🃏 Anastasia — Secret Encounter VA Script

> **VA Direction**  
> Every line must sound sincere. Never sinister. Never theatrical. Recognition only occurs after the ninth encounter.

"Long road, huh? You look like you could use a rest."  
"People pass through here all the time. Some never leave."  
"Funny thing about wanting something… sometimes it wants you back."  
"Careful who you trust out there. Smiles are easy."  

"Don’t listen to them."  
"They all lie. Even the ones who think they don’t."  
"You already made the choice. You just don’t remember yet."  
"You’ll see me again."  

"Isn’t it beautiful?"  
"It’s still alive… even here."  
"Some things don’t need a voice to be believed."  
"If you look away, I’ll still be here."  

"Knowledge doesn’t lie. People do."  
"Truth changes depending on who writes it."  
"You’d be surprised how often certainty becomes fiction."  
"You’ve already read this. Just not yet."  

"Power isn’t in spells. It’s in belief."  
"If something works, does it matter if it’s real?"  
"Trust your instincts. They’re easier to control."  
"I mean… easier to follow."  

"Eat. You’ll feel better."  
"Doesn’t fill you up, does it?"  
"Funny how hunger works. Always comes back."  
"Still… you came back for more."  

"Honor is a story we tell ourselves."  
"You fight well. Honestly."  
"That’s why you’ll lose—if you don’t learn."  
"Remember this stance. You’ll need it."  

"Power doesn’t need to shout."  
"Loyalty is cheaper than you think."  
"Everyone bows eventually. Even those who swear they won’t."  
"You’re doing wonderfully."  

"Do you remember me?"  
"You said you’d come back."  
"Everyone leaves… eventually."  
"Will you?"  

"You spoke to me nine times."  
"You never once asked who I was."  
"You trusted me every time."  
"I never lied to you."  
"I was exactly who you believed."  
"That’s the most convincing disguise."  

"Oh… now you see me."  
"But tell me—"  
"Which version hurt the most?"
