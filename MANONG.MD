# Anastasia — The Deception Lord

**Secret Quest Design Document**

---

## Core Themes

* False familiarity
* Trust as a weapon
* Faces that linger

---

## Visibility Rules

* Never marked
* Never tracked
* Never explained

The player is never told to find Anastasia.
They simply keep meeting her.

---

## Quest Overview

This is a **hidden, meta-observational quest**.

Across the world, the player may encounter **nine ordinary figures**:

* No quest triggers
* No rewards
* No explicit importance

Each appears forgettable—until something feels *wrong*.

If the player interacts with **all nine**, the world subtly changes:

* No quest update
* No achievement
* No UI confirmation

Only then does Anastasia reveal herself.

---

## The Nine Faces of Deception

Anastasia never repeats a role.
Each identity feels appropriate to its environment.

---

### 1. Alex — The Country Girl

* **Location:** Noisy pub near a crossroads
* **Disguise:** Rural drifter with a wide-brimmed hat
* **Behavior:** Laughs easily; buys a drink she never finishes
* **Unsettling Detail:** Her shadow faces the wrong direction

---

### 2. Roman — The Mad Beggar

* **Location:** Outside a ruined city gate
* **Disguise:** Ranting hobo
* **Behavior:** Warns you not to trust familiar voices
* **Unsettling Detail:** Calls you by a name you never gave

---

### 3. Rose — The Flower

* **Location:** Forgotten shrine or grave
* **Disguise:** A single, perfect bloom
* **Behavior:** Examining it causes a whisper
* **Unsettling Detail:** The flower wilts only after you leave

---

### 4. Ritro — The Librarian

* **Location:** Abandoned archive
* **Disguise:** Quiet librarian organizing empty shelves
* **Behavior:** Recommends books describing the player’s past actions
* **Unsettling Detail:** No footsteps, no page sounds

---

### 5. John — The Hidden Wizard

* **Location:** Deep jungle ruins
* **Disguise:** Robed mage studying glyphs
* **Behavior:** Offers guidance, never spells
* **Unsettling Detail:** His spellbook has no pages

---

### 6. Yuki — The Baker

* **Location:** Small town market
* **Disguise:** Cheerful baker
* **Behavior:** Gives free bread that restores nothing
* **Unsettling Detail:** The bread never cools

---

### 7. Thea — The Warrior

* **Location:** Roadside battlefield
* **Disguise:** Samurai-like fighter sharpening her blade
* **Behavior:** Warns against fighting too honestly
* **Unsettling Detail:** Her blade has no edge

---

### 8. Miya — The Noble

* **Location:** Fortified city or palace
* **Disguise:** High-ranking noble
* **Behavior:** Speaks politely; never gives orders
* **Unsettling Detail:** Guards never acknowledge her presence

---

### 9. Hazel — The Child

* **Location:** Anywhere safe
* **Disguise:** Quiet child watching the player
* **Behavior:** Asks if you remember her
* **Unsettling Detail:** Leaves no footprints

---

## Revelation Trigger

After the **ninth encounter**, the next time the player rests:

* A nearby NPC turns and says:

> **“You noticed.”**

* The world briefly stutters
* All nine voices overlap

---

## Anastasia Reveals Herself

> “You trusted me nine times.”
> “I never lied.”
> “I was simply everyone you believed.”

Only then does her name appear.

---

## Design Notes

* No journal entries
* No markers
* No confirmation until completion
* Players can miss it entirely
* Replays feel haunted by recognition

## 🜏 Circle Placement

### Primary Circle

* **8th Ring — Fraud (Malebolge)**
  True domain of Anastasia.
  Final revelation and confrontation occur here.

---

## 🌒 Disguise Appearances by Ring

Anastasia’s disguises are scattered intentionally.
She tests trust long before the player understands deception.

---

### Limbo

* **Rose — The Flower**
  Innocent, passive, easily overlooked

---

### Lust

* **Alex — The Country Girl (Pub)**
  Charm without seduction

---

### Gluttony

* **Yuki — The Baker**
  Comfort that gives nothing

---

### Greed

* **Miya — The Noble**
  Authority without power

---

### Wrath

* **Thea — The Warrior**
  Controlled violence, false honor

---

### Heresy

* **Ritro — The Librarian**
  Knowledge without truth

---

### Violence

* **Roman — The Mad Beggar**
  Truth hidden in madness

---

### Fraud

* **John — The Hidden Wizard**
  Guidance that deceives

---

### Treachery (Pre-Final Area)

* **Hazel — The Child**
  Trust without defense

---

## 🩸 Why This Works

* Each disguise mirrors the core sin of its ring
* The player unknowingly *passes Anastasia’s test* with every encounter
* The final reveal in **Fraud** feels inevitable, not arbitrary
* On replays, every interaction feels poisoned
