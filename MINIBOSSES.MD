**Design Notes:**

* Light units = pressure and mobility
* Heavy units = space control and tanking
* Elite units = mechanical disruption
* Mini bosses = stronger patterns, challenge spikes, unique mechanics
* Environmental units = passive hazard shaping arena behavior
* Rare variants = unpredictable pattern destabilizers

This system ensures each circle of Hell feels mechanically unique while staying true to Dante’s allegorical themes.
