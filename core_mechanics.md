# Combat System Design  Core Mechanics

Rings of the Damned features a high-speed, aggressive combat system blending the movement fluidity of *Ultrakill* with the gritty brutality of *DOOM*. This document outlines the foundational systems that drive player and enemy combat.

##  Player Movement

Movement is the player's primary defense and offense. The goal is momentum-heavy traversal with tight combat control.

- **Base Speed**: 1.2× standard FPS pace (fast and responsive)
- **Jump Height**: Moderate, floaty enough to allow air control
- **Double Jump**: Unlocked after defeating Valentina (Lust)
- **Dash**:
  - 1.0s cooldown
  - 8-directional, can be used mid-air
- **Wall Jumping**: Unlockable or ring-enhanced (e.g. Heresy)
- **Slide**:
  - Long-distance low-profile slide
  - Combos into dash for momentum chaining
- **Mid-Air Control**: Slight steering allowed mid-jump
- **Movement Kill Bonus**:
  - Kill an enemy while sliding or dashing = minor healing or energy


##  Combat Mechanics

The player has three core weapon classes and tactical options designed for constant action:

###  Weapon System

- **Weapon Slots**:
  - **Melee**: Close-range, fast kill options 
  - **Ranged**: Guns, crossbows, energy weapons
  - **Magic**: Ring-triggered abilities or channel spells

- **Firing Modes**:
  - Light and Heavy attack per weapon
  - Alternate fire (if weapon supports it)

- **Ammo System**:
  - **No traditional ammo**
  - Instead, weapons use:
    - **Blood Gauge** (for melee) refilled by kills or executions
    - **Soul Energy** (for magic) generated by combat flow and ring usage

###  Parry System

- **Window**: 2-frame timing on most attacks 
- **Effect**:
  - Parried enemies are staggered 
  - Successful parry emits a directional shockwave
  - Parrying projectiles can reflect them

##  Ring Mechanics in Combat

Rings drastically modify how the player engages in combat.

- **Equip Limit**: 2 rings at a time
- **Ring Swapping**:
  - Swap one ring mid-combat with a 3s animation
- **Ring Bonuses**:
  - Bonuses are active while equipped
  - Debuffs linger until the ring is manually removed

##  Execution System

- **Trigger**: Enemy below 10% HP and for bosses at 5% starts to flash
- **Effect**:
  - Execute with melee to restore HP or Blood Gauge
  - Ring modifiers alter execution animation, effect, or bonus
- **Combo Bonus**:
  - Chaining 5+ executions within 15s grants temporary invulnerability for 1.5s

##  Enemy AI Combat Design

Enemies are built around **aggressive pressure** and **player reaction**.

### Aggression Scale

- **Low-Tier Mobs**:
  - Fast, easily staggered
  - Meant to keep players moving

- **Elite Enemies**:
  - Complex behavior
  - more tanky and heavy hitting

- **Boss-Aware AI**:
  - Bosses learn from player patterns
  - Delayed parry baits, fake-outs, and forced movement

###  Adaptive AI (Later Layers)

- From Layer 4 (GREED) onward, enemies:
  - React to your equipped rings
  - Mimic your last ability used (Bosses/ mini bosses only)
 
##  Synergy System (Early Planning might be an update)

Later versions may implement synergy between:

- **Ring + Weapon**: e.g., Lust Ring + Twin Daggers = Bleed stacking
- **Ring + Arena**: e.g., Equipping Treachery Ring in Layer 9 activates hidden traps or dialogue
- **Weapon + Parry**: Charge weapons get double effect after perfect parry

## Notes for Future 

- **Core Mechanics Finalization Target**: Pre-alpha prototype
- **Combat Prototypes**:
  - Dash → Slide → Melee Chain → Execution
  - Ring Swap → Magic AoE → Parry → Ranged follow-up
